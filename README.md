The Uniform Combined State Law Examination was developed by NASAA based on industry requests. The examination (also called the “Series 66”) qualifies candidates as both securities agents (Series 63) and investment adviser representatives (Series 65). Once registered, FINRA will open a 120-day window within which an individual may schedule the exam.

The Series 66 Exam combines content from the Series 65 and Series 63 exams, focusing on both federal and state securities laws.
